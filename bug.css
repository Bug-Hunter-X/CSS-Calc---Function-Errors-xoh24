The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can cause unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` in a width property might not work as expected if the parent element's width is not explicitly defined. The browser might misinterpret this calculation, resulting in unexpected layout issues. This bug often occurs because `calc()` needs a defined parent width to work correctly. It is also easy to make mistakes in the units, leading to errors.
