# CSS Calc() Function Errors
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the CSS `calc()` function. The problem arises from using `calc(100% - 10px)` to set an element's width without explicitly defining the parent container's width.  This often leads to unexpected layout behavior, where the calculation does not produce the intended results.

The solution involves ensuring that the parent container's width is explicitly set before using `calc()` to determine the child element's width. This ensures that the browser has a clear reference point for the calculation.
